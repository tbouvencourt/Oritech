The pump is used to extract liquids from below. When placed, it extends a trunk downward until it encounters a liquid or obstruction. Once a liquid is found, it scans the liquid body and stores all positions to pump from.

The pump can drain liquid bodies of size 100,000 or smaller. Note that initialization may take a few seconds for large targets.

Drained fluids are stored in the internal storage. The pump can process up to 4 buckets per second, with an energy cost of 512 RF per block.
