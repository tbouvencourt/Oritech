Pockets of crude oil can be found in various underground locations. Large oil reservoirs can also be found on the surface, where they can be seen gushing from the ground.
They are much more common in desert biomes.

Crude oil can be processed with a [centrifuge](../processing/centrifuge) (equipped with a [fluid addon](../processing/addons)) to produce plastic sheets or turbofuel.
