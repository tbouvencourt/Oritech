Fluxite is a crucial component of the flux gate, necessary for constructing some of the more advanced machines.
The most effective way to obtain fluxite is by mining an amethyst cluster with an [enderic laser](../interaction/enderic_laser).

Additionally, fluxite can be found when processing [platinum](../resources/platinum) ores.
